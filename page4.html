                <ul class="list mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                    <li><strong>What does this data set entail? What information does it give us? Why is it significant?</strong><br>This data set entails Airbnb data on dozens of cities and countries around the world. Each city has listings data, reviews data, and calendar data. Calendar data displays whether a listing was available or not for every date between June 6, 2022, which is when the data was scraped, and June 5, 2023. Within the listings data for a specific city, which is much of what we will be focusing on, there is location data, host data, and detailed listing data. Location data includes the approximate latitude and longitude and the neighborhood within the city. Host data includes the host’s name, how many listings they have, and whether they are verified. The detailed listing data includes the amenities, the number of bedrooms, the price, the reviews, and the availability. This data is significant because according to the mission of Inside Airbnb, the project that provides this data, it gives insight into the effect of Airbnb on residential communities.</li>
                    <li><strong>How was this data generated?</strong><br>The Airbnb data was generated by scraping public information from the Airbnb website. The data in the dataset is simply a snapshot of listings at a certain moment in time. For example, if an Airbnb listing is deleted after the data has been generated, the listing and all of its information will still appear in the dataset.</li>
                    <li><strong>What are the original sources？</strong><br>The original sources of this dataset are from the Airbnb website, and all information utilized in this dataset is public information from the website (such as room availability for the future year, and reviews for each listing). All the location information for the listing dataset is anonymized by Airbnb, and the availability information is pretty much dependent on how the host defines availability. The dataset doesn’t use the names of surrounding neighborhoods due to the inaccuracies of the Airbnb site. Instead, the names used for each listing are compiled by comparing the listing’s geographic locations with a city’s definition of neighborhoods.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Who or what organization funded the creation of this dataset? (find out if possible)<br></strong>This dataset was initially created for a project (Inside Airbnb) that helps investigate how Airbnb has impacted its surrounding residential communities. The person that contributed to the creation of this dataset, or the project to create this dataset, was Murray Cox, a community artist and activist, and he got the idea to initiate this project while he was working with Clarisa James, the Executive Director from DIVAS for Social Justice.</li><li><strong>What information, events, or phenomena can your dataset illuminate?</strong><br>From website: “empower communities to understand, decide and control the role of renting residential homes to tourists”. Although our project only focuses on one city (Los Angeles), the dataset itself is actually quite large and contains data for cities all over the world, which means we can have an insight of global airbnb records and their role in local tourism. One of the significant attributes of the Airbnb dataset is the aspect of consumer-side data and host-side data. By looking at the reviews, costs, frequency of nights, and more, we can interpret consumer’s interests and trends in tourism. On the host-side, the nightly rates, neighborhood locations, property size, and more can connect to the changes in the real estate market and explain the negative effects of a huge influx in demand—how tourism impacts gentrification.</li><li><strong>What information is left out? What can the data set not reveal?</strong><br>Our dataset only shows the number and frequency of reviews, but there isn’t any variable showing the actual review or quantifying the review (score or anything). This makes it especially hard to understand how tenants feel about their experiences during their stay. One of the variables is about the availability of Airbnb throughout the year, but this data was measured as the total number of days that this Airbnb is available. Thus, we are not sure if this Airbnb is busier during certain months of the year. In fact, since most of the data in our dataset is measured by the unit of a year, we are unable to obtain detailed or any trends within that year. Although our data set contains thousands of information on the host ID, neighborhood data, price, address, and more, it does not reveal the core information about the guests (customers) who use and purchase the Airbnbs. Thus, it is difficult to obtain the demographic context of the guests and interpret the outside factors that take into account in booking an Airbnb. As the global tourism industry has skyrocketed along with housing prices in neighborhoods with an influx of tourists in local areas, knowing the demographic segmentation would help us understand if one age group is more susceptible to choosing an Airbnb booking over an affordable hotel. Also, if we know one area is more likely to be booked by students or families compared to other areas by senior executives, we could interpret the growth and history in those neighborhoods.</li><li><strong>What are the ideological effects? (You should also give your account of the ideological effects of the way in which your sources have been divided into data (your dataset’s ontology). If your dataset were your only source, what information would be left out?</strong><br>Ideological effects include the way data is divided by location, such as different cities or regions across the globe, rather than by other descriptors such as price or house type. This limits us in our ability to compare only listings within the same region. If the dataset was the only source, other regions would be left out as we are only focusing on the Los Angeles area when analyzing the different pieces of information. As our dataset is recorded mostly quantitatively as consumers make reviews online, we cannot measure the humanistic value in terms of their location interest. For example, we cannot know whether someone values aesthetics over commutability.</li>
